    "In PyTorch, to instantiate a neural network model, we inherit the class nn.Module which grants our class `Net` all the functionality of the nn.Module. We then instantiate it with the init() class. Note however, we must also instantiate the class we are inheriting from (i.e. nn.Module). This alone creates an empty neural network, so to populate it, we add the type of layer we want. In this case, we add a linear layer, a layer that is \\\"fully-connected,\\\" meaning all of its neurons are connected to all the neurons in the previous layer, with no empty connections. This may seem confusing at first because we have not yet seen neural network layers which are not fully-connected; we will see this in the next chapter when we introduce convolutional networks.\n",
